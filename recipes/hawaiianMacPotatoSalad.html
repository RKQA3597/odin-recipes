    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>I grew up eating standard mac salad and potato salad. It wasn't until I got with my husband and had some potato mac salad that I realized the best of both worlds could exist! </p>
    
    <p>It's a local Hawaiian mix plate side favorite of potato mac salad. I think people make it differently, just like potato salad can be made in 101 da kine ways. This is my easy and favorite version of ono (tasty) potato mac.</p>
