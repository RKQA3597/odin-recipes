    <p>I don't mean to brag but my husband makes the best haupia! While I can't give away his secrets, here is a great recipe without his special touch.  </p>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place cornstarch, sugar, and salt into a saucepan; stir in 1/2 cup coconut milk to make a smooth paste. Stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups coconut milk,; bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until thickened so that it coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
