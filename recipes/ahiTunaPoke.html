    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>As a woman with a full time job and doing schooling on the side, I don't often get time to cook. However, my husband is Hawaiian and a great cook. So this recipe is for him!</p>
    
    <p>This easy poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad of fresh ahi tuna steak cubes tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions for a dish full of umami flavor. I like to add chopped macadamia nuts even though they are not authentic â€” they add a delicious crunch! This makes 4 main course servings or 8 appetizer servings.</p>
